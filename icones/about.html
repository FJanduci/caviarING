            <h1 align="center">Origin of Caviar</h1>
            <br>
            <p align="justify">Caviar, a prestigious delicacy, has ancient roots in ancient Persia (present-day Iran), where it was enjoyed as a luxurious delight about 2,000 years ago. The term "caviar" derives from the Persian word "khāg-āvar," meaning "egg eater." This gastronomic treasure found its way to Russia, where the abundant sturgeon in rivers like the Volga and the Caspian Sea made it an essential part of Russian cuisine and high-society festivities.<br>
                During the 18th and 19th centuries, Russian caviar, especially the beluga, oscietra, and sevruga varieties, gained international renown as symbols of quality and luxury. However, the unrestrained quest for caviar and overfishing led to a drastic decline in sturgeon populations worldwide, endangering the species.<br>
                To preserve sturgeon and meet the growing demand, sturgeon aquaculture became a common practice, allowing controlled and sustainable caviar production. Varying in taste and color, caviar varieties include beluga, oscietra, and sevruga, each with its distinct characteristics.<br>
                <img src="icones/esturjao.png" width="800" height="194">
                Caviar is obtained from the eggs of female sturgeons and is prepared for consumption as an elite delicacy. It is typically served with blinis (thin pancakes), sour cream, chopped onion, and sometimes scrambled eggs. Caviar remains a symbol of luxury and is enjoyed on special occasions worldwide.<br>
                Sturgeon conservation and strict regulation aim to ensure the sustainability of caviar production while simultaneously protecting sturgeon populations worldwide. Therefore, caviar, with its rich history and delicacy status, remains a valued culinary gem.
                Caviar, a prestigious delicacy, has a rich and ancient history dating back to Aristotle in the 4th century BC, describing it as sturgeon eggs served at luxurious banquets. However, it was in czarist Russia that caviar reached the height of luxury.<br>
                Essentially, caviar consists of the delicate roe of the female sturgeon, a majestic fish that can reach up to 5.5 meters in length and has migrated through the cold waters of the northern hemisphere for over 250 million years. Although primarily found in the Caspian Sea, Russia and Iran are the major global producers, but it is also found in other regions such as the Black Sea, parts of the Pacific, and European lakes.<br>
                Interestingly, although it is a saltwater fish, sturgeon spawns in freshwater. In the Middle Ages, British kings reserved all sturgeon for their consumption, calling it the "Royal Fish," an exclusive privilege of royalty. However, it was the Persians who began to prepare and savor sturgeon roe.

            <h1 align="center">What is Caviar?</h1>
            <br>
            <p align="justify">
                Caviar is a luxury delicacy made from the roe (eggs) of sturgeon, a fish that primarily inhabits saltwater but spawns in freshwater. The roe is delicately collected from the female sturgeon and processed for human consumption. Due to its smooth texture and rich, distinctive flavor, caviar is considered one of the most exquisite and expensive delicacies in the world.

            <h1 align="center">Sturgeon Varieties</h1>
            <br>
            <p align="justify">
                Caviar is produced from the roe of sturgeon, and different sturgeon species result in distinct varieties of caviar. Some of the most renowned sturgeon species include:
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Beluga:</b> Beluga sturgeon is known to produce the most expensive and rare caviar. Its large roe comes in colors that can include shades of light gray, brown, and black. Beluga caviar is famous for its smooth texture and creamy, mild flavor.</li>
                    <li><b>Oscietra (Osetra or Asestrá):</b> This sturgeon produces the caviar known as Oscietra. Its roe has a variable color, ranging from golden to brown or black. Oscietra caviar is appreciated for its complex flavor, often with nutty notes.</li>
                    <li><b>Sevruga:</b> Sevruga caviar is obtained from the Sevruga sturgeon and is characterized by its smaller, darker roe. It offers a more pronounced flavor compared to Beluga and Oscietra varieties.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h1 align="center">Processing and Preparation</h1>
            <br>
            <p align="justify">
                The caviar production process is highly specialized and requires meticulous care. The roe is carefully collected from sturgeon females, without harming the fish. After collection, the roe undergoes a rigorous cleaning and washing process to remove impurities.<br>
                The amount of salt added to the caviar is a crucial factor in determining its quality. There are three main salinity categories:
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Malossol:</b> This term, originating from Russian and meaning "little salt," is used to describe caviar that is lightly salted. Malossol caviar is highly valued for its delicate and mild flavor. The salting process is carefully controlled to preserve the freshness and texture of sturgeon roe, resulting in a high-quality product treasured by connoisseurs.</li>
                    <li><b>Sevruga:</b> Sevruga caviar is known to be moderately salty. It strikes a balance between the delicate flavor of malossol and the more pronounced taste of highly salted caviar. Its roe typically has a smaller size compared to other sturgeon varieties but still offers a rich and refined taste.</li>
                    <li><b>Salted:</b> This caviar category is characterized by being highly salty. The salting process is more pronounced, resulting in a more intense flavor and firmer texture of the roe. Highly salted caviar may have a more robust flavor profile and is appreciated by those who prefer a saltier and bolder taste.</li>
                </ul>

            <h1 align="center">Why is Caviar So Expensive?</h1>
            <br>
            <p align="justify">
                The high demand and high prices of caviar can be attributed to several factors. The scarcity of wild sturgeon, due to overfishing and aquatic habitat degradation, plays a key role. Many sturgeon species are endangered, leading to strict fishing regulations and the establishment of sturgeon farms to meet the growing demand. Sturgeon is a slow-growing fish, meaning females take many years to produce high-quality roe for caviar.<br>
                Additionally, the caviar production process is highly meticulous and manual, requiring specialized skills. The roe is delicately collected from sturgeon females, hand-washed and cleaned, making it a laborious product to produce.<br>
                The variety of sturgeon also plays a significant role in caviar prices, as different species produce caviars with unique taste, texture, and color characteristics. High-quality caviars, such as Beluga, are rarer and hence more expensive.<br>
                Furthermore, caviar has an intrinsic value that goes beyond taste, being appreciated as a luxury delicacy and a status symbol. This leads many consumers to be willing to pay high prices for the exclusive gastronomic experience that caviar provides.<br>
                Therefore, the combination of scarcity, demand, slow sturgeon growth, manual processing, variety and quality, along with the intrinsic value associated with caviar, contributes to its high prices in the market.<br>
                <b>1 kg of high-quality caviar can cost 2,500 euros (almost 14,000 reais).</b>
